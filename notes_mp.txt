- grid layout isn't gonna work, that's for repeating the same element in a grid
- table layout might work but doing it dynamically might be tricky

implementation:
1. use layout weight to create two columns on the right, and the rest of the space for the name column
2. 'owed', 'paid', and the editable first row of the table can be created in the fragment xml file
  2a. the first row (of current user data) would be populated when we fetch that data from the repo/viewmodel (lifecycle listener)
3. the rest of the rows would be a recycler view that lets us scroll through the other group members

- the grid lines from the mockup might need to be added separately to make it look more like a grid
